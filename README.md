# PyCity Schools Analysis  

### Task: 

Given access to math and reading scores from standardized test results of 15 schools from either District or Charter type, aggregate data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. 

### Methods: 

Create the following reports for ease of analysis. 

- District Summary 

- School Summary 

- Top Performing School By Overall Passing %

- Bottom Performing School By Overall Passing %

- Math Scores by Grade

- Reading Scores by Grade 

- Scores by School Spending

- Scores by School Size 

### Analysis

Our reports seem to support the following observations: 

- The top performing school based on overall passing rate were _*Charter Schools*_.

- The bottom performing schools based on overall passing rate were _*District Schools*_.

- When grouped by school, the average reading and math scores of 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th graders were very similar--within less than 5 point difference from one another.

- The amount of money being spent per student does not seem to contribute to better reading and math scores and overall passing rate--the overall passing rate for students in schools who spend the least is 37% higher than the overall passing rate of students in schools who spend the most per student. 

- Similarly, small and medium size schools out perform larger schools in reading, math and overall passing. 

- Math scores are always the lowest across the board, but there seems to be a significant improvement in math scores and reading scores in charter schools, medium sized district schools, and schools who are spending less than $585 per student.
